CODEBOOK

SUMMARY: The purpose of this data set is to provide clean data and ready for data analysis for wearable computing observations. The data provided were obtained by the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones data set. The original dataset has been has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. The subjects were measured by wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist while doing various activities, i.e., sitting, standing, walking, etc.   The tidy data set provided here focuses on the averages and standard deviations of these activities. As each subject was measured numerous times under each activity we provide compact data looking at the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
 
VARIABLES: In this section the variables of the dataset bodyAverages.txt are described along with their possible values. 

•	"subject" : Refers to the ID of the volunteer under study. Values, 1,  3,  5,  6,  7,  8, 11,  14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29,  and 30 refer to volunteers selected for training while values, 2  4,  9, 10, 12, 13, 18, 20, and 24 refer to volunteers that generated the test data. 


•	"activity" : Refers to the activity of the subject at the moment of the measurement. The possible values are: "laying", "sitting", "standing",         "walking", "walkingDownstairs", and "walkingUpstairs". 

•	"avexmean" : refers to the average value of the mean of x measurements

•	"aveymean" : refers to the average value of the mean  of y measurements.

•	"avezmean" :  refers to the average value of the mean of z measurements.

•	"avexstd" : refers to the average value of the standard deviation of x measurements.

•	"aveystd"  : refers to the average value of the standard deviation of y measurements.


•	"avezstd": refers to the average value of the standard deviation of z measurements.
